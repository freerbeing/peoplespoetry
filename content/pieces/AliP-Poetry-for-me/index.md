Sometimes when my mind is too busy
and my heart too heavy
poetry anchors me and sets me free

I see poetry as a gateway
to radical honesty

I let you see into me
in intimacy

I see strength and beauty
in vulnerability
and I know all our voices are worthy

Poetry undress me
liberate me with a story
caress me with your words
press me up against the prose
truth tingles from my head to my toes

Poetry is naked
stripped bare
of every layer
a sense of what what’s really going on in there

Poetry is the most ancient form of prayer

I pray that poetry will bring hope and connection into our days
to bring clarity to the haze
as we dance through life’s maze
peeling back the layers

And maybe today
your words will walk in a way
that strides and dives
into our insides
and we hear loud and clear
what we need to
to feel, in order to heal

As we collectively feast
on poetry as a sacred meal
we do the prose proud
as we connect our hearts and mouth
and speak out insides out loud

Casting spells in to the collective cauldron
alchemising emotion into poetry
is a potent potion

We are not rebels
We are the revolution
