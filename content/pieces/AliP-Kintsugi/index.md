I thought I was resilient
Independent
Untouchable
Unfuckable

Inside this strong sun of Taurus
is a moon in piecies
and a heart in pieces

My family constellation
forever Changing
i’m floored and I’m raging
no one can save me
i’m drowning in
and doubting
every feeling

I want to run away
but my legs are shaking
did I hear you right
or am I mistaken?
that you’re having a baby

The father of my children
pulls me aside and tells me in the kitchen
that she’s pregnant
asks if I have anything to say or have any questions
I mumble congratulations

My body, so weak by my hearts rapid beatings
i’ll do anything not to feel these feelings

Earth eat me up
Tears take me to the ocean
Smoke blast me to outer space
Alcohol alienate me from my body

But instead I let the music carry me

I sang myself back home
to my bones
over and over with the same three chords
“you’ve got the love to see me through…”
Haven’t you
I have
Have I?
I cried
Unwise
to the twist of this surprise
Time to dive deep inside
whilst I’m this w i d e
open
officially Broken
frozen in motion
crashing to the ashes
flashes of
images
of their happiness
with our daughters
and my aloneness

I guess it’s time to address this mess
get undressed into emotional nakedness
and face this
…It feels relentless

I observe the beauty in the cracks
aware of my tactics to distract
loosing the ability to act okay
as the disguises fade away

I am here raw
and perfectly flawed
tender and sore
torn back to my core

A trembling earth quake
grateful for experiencing break throughs
in this heart break


And i can be brave
but I give myself permission to be strong
to fall apart
being vulnerable is an art

And I’m waiting for the rising part
like a pheonix out the fire
to fix the cracks with gold

Be patient I’m told

I feel like a baby bird
learning to fly
tripping and falling
all over the sky

As the storm passes by

Eyes wide open in wonder
counting for the lightening after the thunder
