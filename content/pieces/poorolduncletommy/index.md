Poor Old Uncle Tommy\
He was a kind and soft-spoken Irish gentleman\
And he didn't deserve that

Always with a smile and a twenty for the kids every time he saw us\
Back when twenty quid meant summing\
He would still give it us, twenty quid, right up to the last time I saw him\
Tho I was in my fifties by then, and 20 quid counted for a lot less in what you could get for it\
It still meant so much\
He was the perfect uncle\
I am so glad I told him that on his 80th birthday

Handsome and hopeful, young Tommy went away to work in London in the 1950s\
Leaving Mayo for his chosen crescendo-ing city like oh so many of his family and friends\
He became head waiter at White's, "The Premier Gentleman’s Club of the Regency" don'cha know, for the Top Knobs\
Prince Charles called him by his first name\
But also called his replacement Tommy when Tommy was off-duty

Tommy would wait until they were pissed\
And switch the vintage for the cheapo that he bought in Sainsburys\
They never noticed\
My how my Mum n Dad n my Uncle Tommy laughed at Christmas, drinking the Taylor's 1929\
At what a bunch of complete feckin' eejits the knobs all are\
Liúdramáns ... the lot of 'em

He came home after 30 years of smiling servitude to look after The Mammy, as the 13 brothers and sisters called her, Norah, my magnificent grandmother\
Carrying cash, a couple of bags and the valium addiction the doctors gave him for his nervous attacks\

Running her little grocery shop whilst The Mammy aged and died\
Forever regretting not having married Bridie, the sweetheart he had left behind, baited by the bright lights beckoning\
He became sad and sadder, in pain and more pain, in body and in mind\
The staple diet of pork products and Guinness telling more so with each passing year

The cancer silent, swift, merciless, soon sucked the life still in him out of him\
He died as the family watched from outside, kept away, beyond the glass window shut tight\
No-one to hold his hand, or tell him that they loved him\
Or laugh about the old days\
He'd had the shots that the doctors gave him, they all had\
But still no contact allowed\
Because people are dying, they said\
His sister, my mother, wasn't allowed visit her home country, to go to the funeral, to mourn with her family

Poor Old Uncle Tommy\
He was a kind and soft-spoken Irish gentleman\
And he didn't deserve that
