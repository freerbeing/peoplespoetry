(Inspired by 'Don't Fall in love with a woman' by Martha Rivera-Garrido)

Don't fall in love with a poem
that speaks to your heart in the darkest days
in ways you cannot imagine

Or one that resonates
in vibrational waves
that saves you
and you feel safe too
and brave enough to face the day

Don't fall in love with a poem
that reads your pain
and writes your hope story
that hears your, feels you, sees you and heals you

or a poem that unearths buried treasure
of forgotten dreams
or painful memories
bearing light
for deep darks souls of the night

Don't fall in  love with a poem
that has the potent power
to unstitch your unconscious borrowed beliefs
at the seams like a welcomed thief
as you patiently patchwork your new aligned reality
into the fabric of your life

Don't fall in love with a poem
that leaves you soft, vulnerable and raw
with questions marks and open doors
more curious than before

Or a poem where the language lingers
the words slip through the grasp of your fingers
and lands slap bang into the centre of your being

Or a poem that inspires you
to write, dance, sob, laugh or sing
or sigh with relief
as it invites you to feel your grief

No don't fall in love with a poem like that
beacuse when you fall in love with a poem like that
whether it stays with you are not
from a poem like that
you never come back
