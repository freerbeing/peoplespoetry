Greg crumples the packet of his fourth Mars bar of the day\
Tosses it over his shoulder into the back seat of his Audi, with all the others\
He sells them, the bars, not the empty packets, and other sugary corporatey confectionary by the lorry load\
If he was part of a Mexican drug-cartel he'd be a capitan\
But with a lot more money, glamour, power, pool parties and women in his life

Thank god, it's Friday\
He's just getting home\
Yet another long week alone driving up and down the motorways and in and out of the towns and cities\
Mum has put his dinner in the microwave

He used to go out on a Friday with his mate\
But these days he locks himself in his room with Netflix, a bottle of vodka and his all-consuming self-pity\
Maybe a porno later\
If he has the energy

He had a girlfriend once\
Seems so long ago now\
It ended badly\
She called his mate and told his mate to tell Greg to back the fuck off or she'd call the police

He used to write and sing and play trumpet, in a band\
Indie Ska Cubano Reggae stylee\
They were very good, actually: inspired, passionate, emotional, evocative\
Greg really expressed something deep\
People danced and sang along and were moved\
But Greg and the band did not measure success like that\
They nearly made it big, Greg says\
Got through the doors at a couple of majors\
And back out again empty-handed\
You don't get shit for "nearly made it" in the music biz

The band argued amongst themselves and broke up\
The once-loved horn sits cold and forsaken in its' closed case in the corner generating in Greg a depressing, subliminal guilt

Tomorrow is football\
He holds a season ticket\
He'll cheer the goals and shout at the mistakes\
He feels, then, for a moment, like he belongs

His mind is as obese as his bloated lumbering body\
All clogged-up with ignorance and needs and hates and worries and regrets and fears and all that\
Because he does not address nor express the feelings inside himself

There is in him\
The endless glorious sunshine of his Eternal Soul\
But he has absolutely no idea about that\
And he'll not be happy in this life no matter how many Mars bars he eats\
Maybe next time round
