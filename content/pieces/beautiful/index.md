I'm not coming on to you, honest\
I want to tell you how you inspired strong feelings in me\
And this poem

You're so very beautiful

A flower-freshness about you\
A babe innocence in your face, in your smile\
Almost translucent\
But not at all like a cold wet jelly-fish lying dead on the beach\
More like an unexpectedly-warm blue moon

Like Helen\
I loved Helen when we were children\
I thought we would marry\
I love her now, in a different way\
Tho as a teen, I loved a different girl with all my wildy-pumping hormone-flooded heart every week\
And although I am still changeable like the wind\
The love I feel now for women is deeper and stiller and more solid in me than that unanchored teenage yearning

But Helen was always different to me\
We connected, sort of\
But I was clumsy, she was shy\
She looked into my eyes and held out her hands to me once\
I looked down at the tarmac and held on to the handlebars of my bike\
I never knew how to say things like this to her\
She would have liked me to, I am sure

Beauty comes with its own issues of course\
The girls can be catty and mean to the pretty one\
The young boys, and the older never-grew-up-yet boys, all goo in the head, and wood in the trousers\
My mates loved her too\
We often loved the same girl at the same time

Helen's as older as me now, of course\
She's had her kids, and still has her husband, thankfully\
I hear Grahame is a good man\
I see her almost never, tho she once surprised me and came round unannounced\
I was a bit freaked out, not at my best, it took me a moment to recognise her\
Shame then rose up in me\
That I did not own a chain of take-away pizza parlours, delivery and everything, like Grahame\
Or have kids, or a wife like Helen

She is still beautiful, in a more experienced and wrinkled and knowing kind of way\
I hear about her\
She's sick with something sounds serious\
I feel sad to think about that

Please forgive me if I am over-familiar with you\
I am trying not to be\
Its just you remind me of someone I love
