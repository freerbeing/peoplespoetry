Summer is Coming

Here's what I will do\
Here's what I will be\
I will do\
I will be\
Then do\
Then be\
Do be do be do

I will walk my path\
Whatever the weather\
Outside or Inside\
I'll adapt my practice\
Pertinent Appropriate\
Working it twirling it\
Hurling me onwards

I will watch the sky\
Listen to the birds\
Rest in the afternoon\
Lazy languid lying on the bed like a limp lettuce leaf\
Retreating in the night into the dark and into my dreams

I will manage my libido\
Sending that supercharge upwards\
Maybe share it if I get the chance\
If it feels right\
Drawing good things with the lead in my pencil

I will feel really really hot\
For days and weeks\
Until convinced there's something wrong with me

I will watch my breath\
Be it clear or be it wretched\
Letting its wild winds blow away the stagnant syrup of my over-heated mind\
If I get ants in my pants\
I'll shake 'em off smiling

I will feel the fleeting feelings of my electro-magnetic body-mind field\
Creeping seeking seeding\
Sometimes fevered even weakling\
Keeping them in context\
In the quiet wisdom of my intuitiing\
As they flow through what I call me\
Changing changing changing

I will eat sparingly but sometimes shitloads\
The best fruit and vegetables that our generous valley has to offer\
And fast inbetween\
Making bean sprouts and banana ice-cream\
Organic tea all the way from China\
I'll cold-brew coffee with fresh clear local spring water\
Have my cake and eat it\
And peanut butter on toast\
And choclit\
And I'm not gonna feel bad about that\
It's beautiful innit?

I will work hard\
But not too hard\
Walking slowly like an African in a desert\
Throwing frisbee for my dog but not too much cos her little heart will pop in the overheat\
Get up early\
Water my trees\
Take care of my finca\
Feed what is working\
Let shrivel what is not

I will be as patient\
As a cactus

I will day-dream\
Laugh\
Maybe cry if the moment calls for it\
Live\
Knowing that this body will be dead soon enough\
Maybe 40 short years more\
Or 40 long minutes\
Over half this little life behind me\
And ahead who knows\
It's late afternoon, at the earliest, in the day of my life\
Evening is coming\
If I'm lucky\
That's ok\
I love love love being alive\
And I'm looking forward to death\
Another glorious adventure\
After this glorious adventure

I will nurture\
Look after things\
Listen to myself\
To others\
To you

I will observe\
Notice\
Without judging\
Or trying to change\
Without criticising\
Or feeling smug\
Ok\
With whatever is\
As it is

Sometimes I will feel alone\
Knowing that alone is impossible in The Oneness\
The Unity

I will listen to music that makes my heart sing along\
Read a good book\
Lots of good books\
That lift me\
Fire me\
Inspire me\
Instruct me\
Absorbed in someone else's heart-sharing

I will write\
I said write, not riot\
It will be too hot for riots\
I will speak my truth\
Not squeak\
Clear\
Coherent\
I promise as honest as I can

I will talk with my friends\
Listen\
Hug\
Love

I will ring my mum n dad every week\
And remind them that I love them

I will sit\
In my silence\
Every day\
Spacing around my private inner garden\
Thinking\
Not thinking\
Watering the flowers so eagerly blooming inside me

I will watch the world whirling\
Without judgement\
When I can\
Us all together\
Part of the weave\
The eternal tapestry\
Neither fixed nor adrift as the patterns we create reveal

I will count my blessings\
When I have time .. there's so many\
I will say thank-you thank-you thank-you

I will deploy my resources\
Making best use\
Watch where the water goes\
Where it doesnt\
Looking in the little nooks and the many crannies\
Acknowledging the differences\
How the land changes in every moment\
The sky\
The river\
The mountains\
Feel the ceaseless unfathomable ever-rolling wonder of the world\
Changing changing changing

I will imagine and expect abundance\
For this little river valley\
For the world\
The abundance that surrounds me\
The abundance that I am

I will glide and soar and roil and roll\
As high as a kite\
Maybe fail and fall as low as dirt\
Feeling everything in between

I will talk sense\
And talk shite\
Jump up and down\
Stand on my head\
Sometimes I will get lost in the dream

I will try not wanting things\
Cos wanting things rarely works out well\
Praying to any god there is or isnt or whatever\
Out there in here nowhere everywhere always never\
I'm not gonna say please god gimme gimme gimme\
Because everything comes to those who wait\
Everything is already here

All these things I will do this summer\
Here comes the summer\
Here comes the summer
