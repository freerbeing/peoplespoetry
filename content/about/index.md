## We are transitioning into the birth of our new earth.

And it is a bloody exciting time to be alive.
It is the time for our poets, our creators, musicians and Trail Blazers to get up and stand up and sing and speak their truth.

The words and songs that channel through us are not for ours to keep.

We are calling on our wordsmith warriors to not stay silent anymore.
Now is not the time for your silence , because the whole world needs to hear you roar in your rawness.

Our Words create worlds

“POETRY FOR THE PEOPLE”

Is not just a poetry night.
This is movement to ignite, encourage and peacefully deliver the birth of our new earth.
To hold a space for all you magical beings out there, that know you were born for this time on earth to share your work, worth and words.
We see you, we believe in you and we want to hear you….

We have journeyed around the majestic mountains having held 10 heart opening and healing poetry for the people events, at a different location each time.
And will continue to move and shake and trail blaze, following the wisdom of words and togetherness.

All upcoming poetry for the people nights and festivals will be shared in this group.

Along with poems from our events that moved you

Be apart of the movement that just by being you and standing in your truth will change the world.

All our love inspiration and encouragement

Ali P and Hannah Mama-Skye
